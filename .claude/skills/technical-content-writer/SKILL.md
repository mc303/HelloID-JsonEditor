Create a skill called "Technical Content Writer" that generates marketing 
content for .NET products and features.

My brand voice for technical content:
- Direct and honest: Avoid marketing hype, focus on real technical benefits
- Practical examples: Show working code snippets, not just theoretical benefits
- Address pain points: Start with the problem .NET developers face
- No buzzwords: Avoid "synergy," "leveraging," "paradigm shift"
- Developer-first language: Respect my audience's intelligence

Content templates to create:

1. Technical blog post structure (problem → solution → implementation):
   - Open with the real problem in .NET development
   - Show how current approaches fall short
   - Introduce the solution with working examples
   - Include performance metrics if applicable
   - Provide actionable next steps

2. Tweet threads for .NET community:
   - Hook with a surprising fact or counterintuitive statement
   - Build credibility with specific technical details
   - Show working example or benchmark
   - End with clear CTA (read more, try it, discuss)

3. Launch announcements:
   - What problem this solves for .NET developers
   - Why existing solutions weren't sufficient
   - Key technical improvements
   - Migration path for existing users
   - When it's available and how to get it

4. Documentation guides:
   - Step-by-step setup instructions
   - Common configuration scenarios
   - Troubleshooting section
   - Performance tuning recommendations

Read the codebase to understand:
- What patterns the application uses
- Performance characteristics
- Integration points
- Target .NET version and framework
- Dependencies and third-party tools

Use this skill when:
- Shipping new features
- Writing technical blog posts
- Creating launch communications
- Documenting architectural decisions
- Explaining performance improvements
